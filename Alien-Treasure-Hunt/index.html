What is original about your game?
In this desert, mystical coins hover in space, our goal is to become rich

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
Understanding how to use phaser and github. This is my first time doing it all.
Therefore, this game isn't finished or perfect.
I have no background in JavaScript so understanding the methods and using them properly took
a lot of research. I had difficulty adding the audio to this game.

I borrowed the assets from <a href="https://opengameart.org"></a>
